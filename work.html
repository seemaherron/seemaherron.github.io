						<p><a href="http://theadstudio.seemaswaran.com">Adstudio</a> is my final project for the MSc in Design and Digital Media at Edinburgh University, that I worked on with Carlos Lopez. 
						<br>
						<br />It involved the creation of an advertising campaign targeting over packaging in Scotland. Working in collaboration with Campaign HQ, a well known advertising agency in Edinburgh, we developed both physical and online advertising material for three separate campaigns. 
						<br>
						<br />The website serves to display final material produced for each campaign.

						<p><a href="http://ddm.caad.ed.ac.uk/mscpages/2007/s0785939/Zillah/index.html">Zillah</a>  was a Headphone based theatre installation that took place on 18th March 2008. 

						<br>
						<br />The central plot involved integrated scenarios where the audience was privy to an insane woman's hallucinations. This was achieved through physical acting, integration of Jitter effects  and video projections.
						<br>
						<br />Although Zillah was a group project, I was primarily resposible for the design and development of both the Alpha and Beta versions of the Zillah website, that was intended to serve as documentation for the Headphone theatre project.

						<p><a href="white_ribbon.pdf"> White Ribbon</a> was a mock up for the white ribbon Scotland campaign that I designed with Illustrator and Photoshop. My design was inspired by the colours of the logo, which was created by Allan Wellburn.
						<br>
						<br>The idea behind this particular campaign idea was to encourage men in taking a stand towards reducing violence against women.

						<p><a href="opencircle.pdf"> Open Circle</a> is a mock up I created with Illustrator, for a counselling company based in Scotland.
						<br>
						<br>I used light colours, and kept the design really simple to blend with the nature of the clients company, and the work they are involved in.
